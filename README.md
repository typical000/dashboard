# Dashboard

:heart_eyes: What we have:
1. Instead of using redux I have used *react-apollo* (with *apollo-link-rest* and *apollo-link-state*). Pretty funny because we don't have any GraphQL here :smiley:
2. Used JSS as cssinjs solution

:scream: What we don't have:
1. Any typechecking
2. Any tests. Both unit and integration.
